# UniBot: A Cost-Effective Universal Wheeled Robot Platform

**UniBot** is a versatile, cost-effective robotic platform designed for human-robot interaction (HRI) and navigation-based research projects. With a maximum continuous payload of 45 kg, UniBot can support up to 60 kg when acceleration is reduced, making it ideal for various experimental and research applications.

## Features
- **Max Continuous Payload**: 45 kg
- **Max Payload (Reduced Acceleration)**: 60 kg
- **Universal Wheeled Design**: Suitable for indoor navigation and HRI applications
- **Cost-Effective**: Built for under 500 USD

## Hardware
All CAD and STL files for the robot platform are available on [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/883918eb14141cee93e4a842/w/890805df5616e18eef3ec22b/e/70bfba5bad746f162eb9c794?renderMode=0&uiState=66fda89e42649e1b87dcbf3a).

## Software
### Ongoing Development (For Experimental Use)
The initial Python code to configure both scooter motors is available, including a command-line interface (CLI) for controlling both motors. As the software is still in progress, it may be subject to changes. Use with caution in experimental setups.
